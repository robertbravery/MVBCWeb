        <h1>WHAT TO EXPECT</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Our Teaching</h3>
        <p>As a Bible church, we strongly hold to studying the Bible in a literal and contextual way. Because of our love and respect for God's Word, the ministry from the pulpit consists primarily of the exposition of Scripture (verse by verse teaching),
            with life-centered application for families and individuals of all ages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Our Worship</h3>
        <p>To worship is to give God the “worth” ship that is due him. Worship is the believer’s response to God for who He is. We worship by listening, speaking/singing, and living in a way worthy of God. At MountainView we love to worship God together
            and it is our desire that our gathered worship of God is a sweet aroma to Him as he sees us giving him the glory for all that he is doing in and through us as we live in obedience to Him. Man was created to worship and God the Creator and
            Savior is worthy of our worship!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Our Prayer</h3>
        <p>MountainView believes in prayer, and we therefore include it as a significant element of every Sunday meeting and during our midweek studies. We are encouraged to be constantly in prayer to God, depending on Him for strength and wisdom and praising
            Him for who He is and what he has done for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Our People</h3>
        <p>Our heartbeat is to help people begin a relationship with Jesus Christ, to develop a deeper walk of faith, and to lovingly serve God and other people. God has called our church family together from many different backgrounds. Though our services
            are in English, we are a multi-ethnic congregation made up of men, women, and children who are bound by a common thread: the person of Jesus Christ.</p>
