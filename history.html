                    <p>Several families, who had been commuting from the south of Johannesburg to Sandton Bible Church in the Fourways area, had the vision to start a new Bible church closer to home. These families asked American missionaries with Biblical
                        Ministries Worldwide, who had been serving at Sandton Bible Church, if they would lead the new church plant in the south.</p>
                    <p>The initial efforts began with a series of Bible studies, and as God worked through relationships, the group expanded, and on 31 October 2004, Sunday morning services began in Glenanda.</p>

                    <p>We saved up for years toward the purchase of our own building, and in August of 2010, we purchased a house in Glenanda (four houses away from where MountainView began in 2004!) that had a massive living area that we could renovate
                        into a church hall. The house has become home and is now a very busy place! God has continued to provide leadership for the church through the years from missionaries and local men. As we continue to grow, both in numbers and financially,
                        we look forward to moving into a larger facility in the future.</p>
