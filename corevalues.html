        <h1>OUR CORE VALUES</h1>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <h5><strong>We Are Committed to God's Word</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe the Bible is the Word of God and that its principles are sufficient to guide us in everything we do, as individuals and as a fellowship.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <h5><strong>We Are Committed to God</strong></h5>
            <p>Together, we want to glorify God through worship, prayer, and celebration of the Lord's Supper and baptism. Individually, we want to live out our devotion to God through prayer, scripture memory, and Bible study, striving to deny ourselves
                and display a life of integrity, sacrifice, and character in our pursuit of Christlikeness.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <h5><strong>We Are Committed to Fellow Believers</strong></h5>
            <p>We highly value unity, fellowship, and meeting each other's spiritual and physical needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <h5><strong>We Are Committed to Evangelism</strong></h5>
            <p>We place a high priority on reaching our community with the gospel in a personal and relevant way.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <h5><strong>We Are Committed to Discipleship</strong></h5>
            <p>We have a passion to enhance the spiritual growth of every believer through life-on-life relationships in order to bring them to maturity in Christ and equip them to lead and serve others.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <h5><strong>We Are Committed To Learning, Flexibility And Innovation</strong></h5>
            <p>While preserving the biblical truths and traditions of the New Testament church, we desire to be life-long learners and innovators in reaching people with the gospel in an ethnically and culturally diverse society.</p>
