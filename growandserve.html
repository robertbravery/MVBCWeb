	<!--Introduction-->
	<p>A "church" is a group of believers committed to the Lord and each other. It is not the corporation, the "ministry professionals," or the Sunday morning event. We want our primary ministry to be person-to-person throughout the week. We meet together as believers to grow and encourage one another in the Lord, so that we might be equipped and excited about serving the Lord in our homes, at school, at work, in our communities and around the world every moment of every day.</p>
	<!--End of Introduction-->
	<div>
		<h2>Prayer</h2>
		<p>MountainView believes in prayer, and we therefore include it as a significant element of every Sunday meeting and during our midweek studies. We are encouraged to be constantly in prayer to God, depending on Him for strength and wisdom and praising Him for who He is and what he has done for us.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Worship</h2>
		<p>To worship is to give God the "worth" ship that is due him.  Worship is the believer's response to God for who He is. We worship by listening, speaking/singing, and living in a way worthy of God.  At MountainView we love to worship God together and it is our desire that our gathered worship of God is a sweet aroma to Him as he sees us giving him the glory for all that he is doing in and through us as we live in obedience to Him. Man was created to worship and God the Creator and Savior is worthy of our worship!</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Weekly Bible Study</h2>
		<p>In addition to our Sunday Morning Service, we often have weekly Bible Studies in member's homes.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Silver Saints</h2>
		<p>Our "older" folks meet together about every six weeks for a devotional, a time of fellowship and encouragement. Please contact the church for the next event.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Ladies' Studies</h2>
		<p>Our ladies meet once a month for Bible Study and encouragement. Please contact the church for current details about upcoming activities for the ladies.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Men's Studies and Activities</h2>
		<p>Our men meet from time to time for Bible Studies, prayer, and activities.  Please contact the church for the next men's event.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Children's Church</h2>
		<p>Children's Church is provided for children ages 3-11. A number of teachers provide songs, activities and crafts, and teach God's Word to primary-age children during the morning message.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Creche</h2>
		<p>A creche is available at the church. If a parent would like to take their baby or small child to a room with toys and a little space to run around during the Sunday morning service, they can stay with their child and still hear the message through a speaker system.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Primary Youth - Fridays</h2>
		<p>Every Friday evening at 7 PM at the church property, kids (ages 4-11) have games, contests, a snack, and a good time learning God's Word!</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Anomaly (Teens) - Fridays</h2>
		<p>The teens meet Friday evening at 7 PM for fellowship, games, activities, singing and a Bible study.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Bible Institute</h2>
		<p>From the beginning of MountainView Bible Church, in-depth Bible Courses has been a core element of building up believers to adequately prepare and equip our members for teaching and serving ministries in and outside of the church. Recently we have had courses on theology, hermeneutics, parenting, and the gospel of John.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Compassion Ministry</h2>
		<p>We provide meals for those who have been sick, in hospital, had a baby, moved residences, or otherwise could use the help of the church in providing meals. This is done primarily for the church body, through from time to time we have opportunity to serve those in the community as well. We also encourage our families to be involved with care for orphans in the midst of our great need in South Africa.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Missions</h2>
		<p>MountainView prayerfully and financially supports three missionary families.</p>
