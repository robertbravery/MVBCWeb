            <p>At MountainView, we understand that God has gifted every believer for ministry and as each person serves according to their gifts and abilities the whole body is built up together. Some of these ministries include serving through music, food preparation and service, teaching, financial administration, maintenance of the building and grounds, prayer, compassion outreach, leading different ministries, planning events, evangelism, hospitality, overseeing the audio and visual presentation, discipleship, youth ministry, visiting the sick and elderly and more. We do not all have the same function, but we are all one in Christ.</p>

                <h4>Brady Farr</h4>
                <p>Our family moved to Johannesburg from the United States in 2011 to serve at MountainView Bible Church. Before moving to South Africa, we had the pleasure of serving in pastoral ministry in two different churches in the U.S. from 1996-2010. Candy grew up as a missionary kid in the    Amazon jungle of Venezuela and Brazil. After meeting in Bible College, Candy and I were married in 1993 and God has blessed us with four biological children and two South African foster children, who we are in the process of adopting. We count it a wonderful privilege to serve       the Lord together with the people of MountainView Bible Church.</p>

                <h3><strong>Deacons</strong></h3>
                <p>MountainView also has four deacons. These men carry much of the weight of the ministry at MountainView. They are responsible for member care, building care, church finances and coordinating church programs and
                    events.

                <div>
                    <h3>Beginnings 2003-2004</h3>
                    <p>Several families, who had been commuting from the south of Johannesburg to Sandton Bible Church in the Fourways area, had the vision to start a new Bible church closer to home. These families asked American missionaries with Biblical
                        Ministries Worldwide, who had been serving at Sandton Bible Church, if they would lead the new church plant in the south.</p>
                    <p>The initial efforts began with a series of Bible studies, and as God worked through relationships, the group expanded, and on 31 October 2004, Sunday morning services began in Glenanda.</p>

                    <h3>Expansion 2005-2009</h3>
                    <p>MountainView moved to the Sha-Mani Conference Centre in Alberton in 2005 and met there for several years. As children, youth, and ladies' and men's ministries grew, the church to almost 80 believers.</p>

                    <h3>Existing Church Home - 2010-Present</h3>
                    <p>We saved up for years toward the purchase of our own building, and in August of 2010, we purchased a house in Glenanda (four houses away from where MountainView began in 2004!) that had a massive living area that we could renovate
                        into a church hall. The house has become home and is now a very busy place! God has continued to provide leadership for the church through the years from missionaries and local men. As we continue to grow, both in numbers and financially,
                        we look forward to moving into a larger facility in the future.</p>
