	<h1 style="text-align:center">Our Teaching</h1>
	<p>As a Bible church, we strongly hold to studying the Bible in a literal and contextual way. Because of our love and respect for God's Word, the ministry from the pulpit consists primarily of the exposition of Scripture (verse by verse teaching), with life-centered application for families and individuals of all ages.</p>
	<p>While we do often enjoy topical preaching series in between biblical book studies, the core of our teaching is working through Old and New Testament books chapter by chapter and verse by verse. We believe that God's Word has the power to transform our lives as believers in a glorious way. The Bible alone is our standard for faith and practice.</p>
