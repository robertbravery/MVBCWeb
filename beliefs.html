	<h1 style="text-align:center">OUR BELIEFS</h1>
	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>The Scriptures</strong> - We believe the Bible to be the inspired Word of God, without error in the original manuscripts, and the final authority in all matters of faith and life.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>The Godhead</strong> - We believe in one Triune God, Creator and Sustainer of the universe, eternally existing in three persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>The Lord Jesus Christ</strong> - We believe the Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, that he was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died on the cross to take away the sins of the world, bodily rose again the third day, and has ascended to heaven to serve as our high priest and advocate.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>The Holy Spirit</strong> - We believe the Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, regenerates and baptizes believers into the body of Christ, and indwells and seals believers until the day of Christ's return. We believe the Holy Spirit gives spiritual gifts to all believers for the building up of his church and that the miraculous sign gifts were foundational in purpose and now that we have the complete Scriptures, they are no longer given for the present ministry of the church.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Sin</strong> - We believe that all have sinned, are guilty before God, and are unable to remedy their lost condition.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Salvation</strong> - We believe that salvation is the gracious gift of God, and is received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of sins. We believe that those who are once saved, are kept by God's power and are secure in Christ forever.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>The Church</strong> - We believe the Church is the spiritual body of Christ composed of all true believers in Christ Jesus. We believe the gathering of the Church began on the Day of Pentecost as recorded in Acts 2 and will continue until Christ returns for his Church. We believe that the Church is to gather regularly in local bodies for study of God's Word, prayer, worship, celebration of the Lord's Supper, baptism, and fellowship.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>The Future</strong> - We believe in the personal, imminent, pre-tribulation and pre-millennial coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for his redeemed ones; and in his subsequent return to earth, with his saints, to establish his millennial kingdom. We believe in the eternal punishment of the unbeliever and the eternal life of the saved.</p>
