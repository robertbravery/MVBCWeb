        <h1>OUR BELIEFS</h1>


    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h3 class="well well-sm">Our Teaching</h3>
            <p>As a Bible church, we strongly hold to studying the Bible in a literal and contextual way. Because of our love and respect for God's Word, the ministry from the pulpit consists primarily of the exposition of Scripture (verse by verse teaching),
                with life-centered application for families and individuals of all ages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h3 class="well well-sm">Our Doctrine</h3>
            <h5><strong>The Scriptures</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe the Bible to be the inspired Word of God, without error in the original manuscripts, and the final authority in all matters of faith and life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>The Godhead</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe in one Triune God, Creator and Sustainer of the universe, eternally existing in three persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>The Lord Jesus Christ</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe the Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, that he was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died on the cross to take away the sins of the world, bodily rose again the third day, and has ascended to heaven to serve as our
                high priest and advocate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>The Holy Spirit</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe the Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, regenerates and baptizes believers into the body of Christ, and indwells and seals believers until the day of Christ's return. We believe the Holy Spirit gives spiritual gifts to all believers
                for the building up of his church and that the miraculous sign gifts were foundational in purpose and now that we have the complete Scriptures, they are no longer given for the present ministry of the church.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>Sin</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe that all have sinned, are guilty before God, and are unable to remedy their lost condition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>Salvation</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe that salvation is the gracious gift of God, and is received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of sins. We believe that those who are once saved, are kept by
                God's power and are secure in Christ forever.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>The Church</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe the Church is the spiritual body of Christ composed of all true believers in Christ Jesus. We believe the gathering of the Church began on the Day of Pentecost as recorded in Acts 2 and will continue until Christ returns for his
                Church. We believe that the Church is to gather regularly in local bodies for study of God's Word, prayer, worship, celebration of the Lord's Supper, baptism, and fellowship.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>The Future</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe in the personal, imminent, pre-tribulation and pre-millennial coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for his redeemed ones; and in his subsequent return to earth, with his saints, to establish his millennial kingdom. We believe in the
                eternal punishment of the unbeliever and the eternal life of the saved.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="values" class="paragraph-section">
            <h3 class="well well-sm">Our Values</h3>
            <h5><strong>God's Word</strong></h5>
            <p>We believe the Bible is the Word of God and that its principles are sufficient to guide us in everything we do, as individuals and as a fellowship.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>God</strong></h5>
            <p>Together, we want to glorify God through worship, prayer, and celebration of the Lord’s Supper and baptism. Individually, we want to live out our devotion to God through prayer, scripture memory, and Bible study, striving to deny ourselves
                and display a life of integrity, sacrifice, and character in our pursuit of Christlikeness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>Fellow Believers</strong></h5>
            <p>We highly value unity, fellowship, and meeting each other’s spiritual and physical needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>Evangelism</strong></h5>
            <p>We place a high priority on reaching our community with the gospel in a personal and relevant way.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>Discipleship</strong></h5>
            <p>We have a passion to enhance the spiritual growth of every believer through life-on-life relationships in order to bring them to maturity in Christ and equip them to lead and serve others.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section">
            <h5><strong>Learning, Flexibility, and Innovation</strong></h5>
            <p>While preserving the biblical truths and traditions of the New Testament church, we desire to be life-long learners and innovators in reaching people with the gospel in an ethnically and culturally diverse society.</p>
